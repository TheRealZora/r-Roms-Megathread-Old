## **Quota bypass methods**<br/>

**Google Drive Quota Bypass Method:**


From time to time, when trying to download a file, you might see an error message saying “Download quota exceeded, so you can’t download this file at this time”. Here’s how to bypass that message and download what you want:

1. Log into your Google account, if you haven’t already.
2. Go to Google Drive, and click “My Drive” in the sidebar.
3. Make a new folder in your drive, it doesn’t matter what you name it.
4. Go to the quota'd folder, and right click on whatever you want to download and press “Add Shortcut to Drive”.
5. Navigate to “My Drive” and then to the folder you made, then press “Add Shortcut”.
6. Go to “My Drive” on the sidebar, then right click the folder you made and press “Download”.
7. A zip file will be made with the file(s) you selected. Enjoy!

**Mega.nz & 1Fichier Quota Bypass Method:**

The file hosting services mega.nz and 1fichier have pretty serious data caps, and unlike google drive, there's no super easy way to get around them. To bypass the mega.nz & 1fichier quotas you will need either a VPN or a list of proxies. For the VPN just connect and you're good to go. For the proxies you'll need to use some 3rd party tool like [JDownloader2](https://jdownloader.org/jdownloader2) and give it the list of proxies, do note that this process is fairly advance and shouldn't be attempted by people who don't know computers very well. After that you can just start downloading by giving JDownloader2 links to the files you would like to download.
